# A. Personal Statement

```{r}
#| child: bio.Rmd
```

I look forward to contributing to the "Better Respiratory Environment And Tobacco Harm Elimination in CF(BREATHE-CF)" study as a CCHMC site investigator.
I will implement secure, HIPAA-compliant geocoding and geomarker assessment for study sites using methods and tools developed by my research group and supported by the NIH.
I will also contribute to the statistical analysis, interpretation of results, and publication of results.

## Ongoing projects that I would like to highlight include:

```{r}
make_support_entry <- function(x) {
  glue::glue_data(
    x,
    "{source} {number}",
	"{pi_name} (PI)",
    "{start_date} - {end_date}",
    "*{title}*",
    .sep = "  \n", .na = ""
  ) 
}
```

```{r}
#| results: asis
yaml::yaml.load_file("support.yaml") |>
  purrr::keep(\(x) x$status == "Active") |>
  purrr::map_chr(make_support_entry) |>
  cat(sep = "\n\n")
```

## Peer-reviewed publications I would like to highlight include:

```{r}
cite_four <- function(.x) {
  stopifnot(length(.x) <= 4)
  pubs <- yaml::yaml.load_file("pubs.yaml")
  stopifnot(all(.x %in% names(pubs)))
  the_pubs <- purrr::map(.x, \(.) purrr::pluck(pubs, .))
  the_pubs |>
    purrr::map_chr(\(.) glue::glue_data(.,
                           "1",
                           "{paste(author, collapse = ', ')}",
                           "{title}",
                           "*{journal}*",
                           "{issue_pages}",
                           "{year}. \n &nbsp; &nbsp; \n",
                           .sep = ". ",
                           .na = character())) |>
    purrr::map_chr(\(x) gsub("Cole Brokamp", "**Cole Brokamp**", x = x, fixed = TRUE)) |>
    cat(sep = "\n\n")
}
