  title: "Enhancing the Sustainability and Impact of Geomarker Assessment Tools for Research"
  goals: "Project Narrative This project aims to enhance DeGAUSS, a vital research tool that enables large-scale, privacy-preserving geocoding and geomarker assessment of health data. By improving its scalability, interoperability, and accessibility, we will make it easier for researchers to understand how environmental factors influence health outcomes. This work supports the NIH’s mission to leverage advanced data tools and technologies to improve public health."
