*Comparison of Hemorrhagic & Ischemic Stroke Among Blacks and Whites*  
Kleindorfer, PI (04/01/15 - 03/31/20)

**Internal Processes and Methods Award - Center for Clinical & Translational Science & Training**  
*Using Machine Learning to Supplement Electronic Health Record databases with Individual Socioeconomic Status*  
Brokamp, PI (9/1/17 - 6/30/20)  
Retrospective epidemiological studies are often created using electronic health record databases.  Although these records are "wide", they are not "deep" with respect to individual level demographic data.  We propose a novel machine learning based approach that uses open city and auditor databases to predict individual level income and family socioeconomic status.  This will solve the urgent problem of unconfounding for individual SES in the execution of EHR based research.  
Role: PI

*Childrenâ€™s Respiratory Research and Environment Workgroup (CREW)*  
Gern, PI (9/01/2016 - 8/31/2023)  
This consortium will identify asthma endotypes and overcome shortcomings of individual cohorts by providing a large (nearly 9000 births and long-term follow-up of 6000-7000 children and young adults) and diverse national data set, harmonizing data related to asthma clinical indicators and early life environmental exposures, developing standardized measures for prospective data collection across CREW cohorts and other ECHO studies, and conducting targeted enrollment of additional subjects into existing cohorts.  
Role: Co-I  


**NIH/NIEHS R21ES030092**  
*Developing and Evaluating Novel Strategies for Reporting Back Individual Results of Personal Air Monitors*  
Ryan, PI (9/1/19 - 9/1/21)  
This project will work to develop new methods for reporting individual-level personal air pollution concentrations to study subjects to better help them understand the risk of air pollution and to modify their behavior to improve health outcomes.  
Role: Co-I  


**NIH/NHLBI R01HL141286-01A1**  
*Mapping Environmental Contributions to Rapid Lung Disease Progression in Cystic Fibrosis*  
Sczcesniak, PI (1/1/19 - 12/31/23)  
The overall objective of this research is to leverage a rich CF registry, extant national and local environmental data sources, and prospectively collected study data to accurately forecast the onset of rapid decline progression.  
Role: Co-I  


**NIH/NIA R21AG057983**  
*A Novel Research Infrastructure Enabling Life-Course Studies of Healthy Aging*  
Woo/Urbina, PI (8/15/18 - 7/31/23)  
The goal of this two-phase study is to develop the data and biospecimen infrastructure for the Bogalusa Heart Study, the Princeton Lipid Research Study and the NHLBI Growth and Health Study (R21 phase) and to conduct pilot evaluations of the feasibility, acceptability and validity of data collected using a variety of biometric sensors relating to cardiometabolic risk, sleep quality and cognition in these cohorts (R33 phase). These two phases will together prepare these cohorts for future aging-related studies.  
Role: Co-I  


**ECHO Opportunities and Infrastructure Fund Award**  
*Decentralized and Reproducible Geomarker Assessment for Multi-Site Studies*

Role: PI  


**Ohio Department of Health Contract No. CSP907820**  
*Model Identifying Geographic Areas in Ohio for Blood Lead Testing*  
Brokamp, PI (4/15/2020 - 9/30/2020)  
This award will develop a predictive model to determine which children should be tested for potentially high blood lead during physician visits based on their residential location.  
Role: PI  


**AHRQ PEDSnet K12**  
*Inpatient Screening for Parental Adversity and Resilience*  
Shaw, PI (1/1/19 - 12/31/20)  
This award will work to establish and implement a screening approach for the assessment of parental adverse childhood experiences in the hospital setting.  
Role: Co-I  
 

### Pending

**NIH NLM 1R01LM013222-01A1**  
*A Framework for Automated and Reproducible Geomarker Curation and Computation at Scale*  
Brokamp, PI (4/1/20 - 3/31/24)  
This award will create a framework for developing a standardized, free and open source library of reproducible and computable geomarkers that will enhance the efficiency and collaboration of biomedical researchers utilizing place-based data at scale.  
Role: PI  


**NIH NLM 1R01LM013420-01**  
*Development of an Electronic Health Records to Enhanced Research Database Pipeline With Applications in Intrauterine Substance Exposures*  
Brokamp/Hall, PI (7/1/20 - 6/30/24)  
Our objective in this work is to develop an approach to allow biomedical researchers to more fully harness EHR content, including structured and free-text components, and to facilitate enhanced research dataset creation through repeated, automated EHR extractions including automatic integration of geomarkers and external  datasets.  
Role: Co-PI

**Internal Arnold W. Strauss Fellowship Award - Cincinnati Children's Hospital**  
*Assessing Exposure to Air Pollution Across Time and Space*  
Brokamp, PI (7/1/16 - 6/30/17)  
The primary objective of this award is to combine satellite-based measurements, land use characteristics, and meteorologic data to create a hybrid spatiotemporal model for ground level exposure to particulate matter using exact addresses and dates.  
Role: PI  


**Internal Processes and Methods Award - Center for Clinical & Translational Science & Training**  
*Validating a Geocoding Approach for Multi Site Studies*  
Brokamp, PI (1/24/17 - 6/30/17)  
The primary objective of this award is to compare the geocoding (assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to addresses) accuracy of our software DeGAUSS (DEcentralized Geomarker Assessment for mUlti Site Studies) to with other common geocoding software. Furthermore, each method will be evaluated based on it ability to correctly estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics.
