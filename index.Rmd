I am an Assistant Professor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center interested in causal inference for machine learning, geoinformatics, environmental and population health, and fairness in precision medicine. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics & Bioinformatics in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati and did my postdoctoral training at Cincinnati Children's in Biostatistics & Epidemiology.

Currently, I am:

- Estimating the heterogeneous effects of environmental exposures on childhood health outcomes
- Creating causal inference methods for random forest
- Developing statistical computing tools for geocoding and geomarker assessment
- Designing interactive web applications for exploring the social determinants of health
