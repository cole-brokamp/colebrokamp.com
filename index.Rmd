I am currently a research fellow at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center interested in geoinformatics, remote sensing, environmental health, statistical computing, and statistical inference for machine learning algorithms. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati. As part of my dissertation work ([text](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/cole-brokamp.github.io/raw/master/publications/Cole%20Brokamp%20Dissertation%2024March2016.pdf)/[slides](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/cole-brokamp.github.io/raw/master/publications/Cole%20Brokamp%20Dissertation%20Defense%2023March2016.pdf)), I created a novel random forest land use model to predict children's exposure to air pollution and its effect on their health.

Currently, I am:

- Developing a spatiotemporal air pollution exposure assessment model for Cincinnati, Ohio
- Testing and implementing causal inference methods for random forest
- Creating statistical computing tools for geocoding and environmental exposure assessment
- Designing interactive web applications for exploring the social determinants of health
