I am an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine interested in geoinformatics, environmental and population health, and fairness in precision medicine. My research is focused on understanding the heterogeneous effects of environmental exposures and community characteristics on childhood psychiatric and neurobehavioral health outcomes. I am also interested in developing new methods and technologies to support environmental and population health research, including statistical computing tools for geocoding and geomarker assessment, high resolution spatiotemporal air pollution exposure assessment models, and causal inference machine learning methods.
