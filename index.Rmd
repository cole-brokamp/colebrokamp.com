I am an Assistant Professor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center interested in geoinformatics, environmental health, statistical computing, population health, and statistical inference for machine learning. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics & Bioinformatics in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati and did my postdoctoral training at Cincinnati Children's in Biostatistics & Epidemiology.

Currently, I am:

- Evaluating the heterogeneous causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood health outcomes
- Testing and implementing causal inference methods for random forest
- Creating statistical computing tools for geocoding and environmental exposure assessment
- Designing interactive web applications for exploring the social determinants of health
