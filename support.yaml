title: Validating a Geocoding Approach for Multi Site Studies
description: The primary objective of this award is to compare the geocoding (assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to addresses) accuracy of our software DeGAUSS (DEcentralized Geomarker Assessment for mUlti Site Studies) to with other common geocoding software. Furthermore, each method will be evaluated based on it ability to correctly estimate environmental exposures and community-level characteristics.

title: Using Machine Learning to Supplement Electronic Health Record databases with Individual Socioeconomic Status
description: Retrospective epidemiological studies are often created using electronic health record databases.  Although these records are "wide", they are not "deep" with respect to individual level demographic data.  We propose a novel machine learning based approach that uses open city and auditor databases to predict individual level income and family socioeconomic status.  This will solve the urgent problem of unconfounding for individual SES in the execution of EHR based research.

title: Data-driven discovery of subpopulations susceptible to the health effects of air pollution
description: The overall objective of this application is to develop methods to identify subpopulations most susceptible to the health effects of air pollution using a database of over 35 individual- and community-level susceptibility characteristics within both (1) a dataset derived from electronic health records in order to identify subpopulations susceptible to acute PM2.5-related risks of psychiatric, respiratory, and cardiovascular emergency department visits and (2) a population-wide administrative database of mother-infant dyads to identify subpopulations susceptible to chronic gestational PM2.5-related risks of low birth weight, preterm birth weight, and hospitalization during the first year of life.

title: A Novel Research Infrastructure Enabling Life-Course Studies of Healthy Aging
description: The goal of this two-phase study is to develop the data and biospecimen infrastructure for the Bogalusa Heart Study, the Princeton Lipid Research Study and the NHLBI Growth and Health Study (R21 phase) and to conduct pilot evaluations of the feasibility, acceptability and validity of data collected using a variety of biometric sensors relating to cardiometabolic risk, sleep quality and cognition in these cohorts (R33 phase). These two phases will together prepare these cohorts for future aging-related studies.
