### **[LinnStrument Scales](http://linnstrument-scales.amazon-shiny.duckdns.org)**

An R Shiny application ([source code](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/linnstrument_scales)</icon></icon>) that illustrates notes on LinnStrument for any given base key and scale mode. A navigation bar offers three modes: (1) small scale that only shows one octave of a scale with note numbers, (2) large scale that shows the scale over several octaves without note numbers, and (3) large scale overlays that shows one large scale and a different scale overlapping in order to compare scale layouts for different base keys and modes.

### **Location-based Prediction of Air Pollution Exposure**

An R Shiny application which allows uploading of latitude and longitude coordinates and returns the estimated average daily exposure to traffic related air pollution. Optionally, it can also return the distance to the nearest interstate and highway, as well as various other census tract derived variables. This tool has been widely used within the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in both clinical and research settings.
