\textbf{\texttt{aiR}}~\\
aiR is used to assess PM2.5 exposures in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. The
package creates predictions based on a spatiotemporal hybrid
satellite/land use random forest model. PM2.5 exposure predictions are
available at 1 x 1 km grid resolution covering the seven county area
(OH: Hamilton, Clermont, Warren, Butler; KY: Boone, Kenton, Campbell) on
a daily basis from 2000 - 2015.\\

A software package for linux that geocodes using TIGER/Line data.
Offline geocoding is useful when dealing with private health
information. This software is also implemented on a internal server,
available to researchers at CCHMC.\\
