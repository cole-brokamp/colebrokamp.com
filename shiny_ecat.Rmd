### **Location-based Prediction of Air Pollution Exposure**

An R Shiny application which allows uploading of latitude and longitude coordinates and returns the estimated average daily exposure to traffic related air pollution. Optionally, it can also return the distance to the nearest interstate and highway, as well as various other census tract derived variables.
